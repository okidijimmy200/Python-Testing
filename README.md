This is the code repository for [Crafting Test-Driven Software with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/crafting-test-driven-software-with-python/9781838642655), published by Packt.

**Write test suites that scale with your applications needs and complexity, using Python and PyTest**

## What is this book about?
Test-driven development (TDD) is a set of best practices that helps developers to build more scalable software, and is used to increase the robustness of software by using automatic tests. This book shows you how to apply TDD practices efficiently in Python projects.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Find out how tests can make your life easier as a developer and discover related best practices
* Explore and learn PyTest, the most widespread testing framework for Python
* Get to grips with the most common PyTest plugins, including coverage, flaky, xdist, and picked
* Write functional tests for WSGI web applications with WebTest
* Run end-to-end tests for web applications using the Robot framework

```
import unittest

class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_one(self):
        pass
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Python developers looking to get started with test-driven development and developers who want to learn about the testing tools available in Python. Developers who want to create web applications with Django and Python and plan to implement TDD methodology with PyTest will find this book useful. Basic knowledge of Python programming is required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
